<!-- YEAR 1 -->
<section class="scene">
    <h2>Year 1 🌱</h2>
    <p>
        I first saw your photo on my sister’s phone.
        I didn’t know your voice.
        I didn’t know your story.
        But somehow… it felt like love at first sight.

<!-- YEAR 2 -->
<section class="scene">
    <h2>Year 2 🌿</h2>
    <p>
        All I wanted was a conversation.
        Just to talk to you.
        Just to know you a little more.

<!-- SPECIAL MEMORY -->
<section class="scene">
    <h2>14 February 2022 💌</h2>
    <p>
        On 14th February 2022,
        you sent me a photo.
        My heart skipped a beat.
        And for a moment,
        I didn’t even understand what I was feeling.

<!-- YEAR 3 -->
<section class="scene">
    <h2>Year 3 🌳</h2>
    <p>
        I finally made it.
        But I was immature.
        I made mistakes.
        I messed things up more times than I should have.
        Still… my feelings never changed.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- YEAR 4 -->
<section class="scene">
    <h2>Year 4 🌸</h2>
    <p>
        One of my dreams came true — I finally met you.
        There’s just one thing that stayed stuck in my mind…
        your tiny hand.
        I still smile thinking about it.
    </p>

<!-- YEAR 5 -->
<section class="scene">
    <h2>Year 5 🌙</h2>
    <p>
        I’ve already confessed my feelings to you before.
        But this time, it’s different.
        I’m working towards a job.
        I’m working towards a future.
        And one day, I want to properly propose to you.

        I know life doesn’t always go as planned.
        If I’m late, please wait for me.
        I want to build my future with you.
        Will you be my Valentine?
        Will you go on a date with me?
        <strong>I hope your answer will be yes.</strong>
